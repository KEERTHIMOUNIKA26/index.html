    <h1>HTML IMPORTANT QUESTIONS</h1> 
    <h2>1.What is HTML?</h2>
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and structure web pages.
It defines the content and layout using tags.
It helps display text, images, links, tables, and more on browsers.

<h2>2. Markup Language vs Programming Language – What is the difference?</h2>
A markup language (like HTML) structures and presents data but doesn't perform logic or calculations.
A programming language (like Python or JavaScript) can perform logic, loops, and computations.
In short, markup is for layout; programming is for functionality.
